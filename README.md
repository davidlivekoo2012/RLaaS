# RLaaS - Reinforcement Learning as a Service Platform

## 🚀 Overview

RLaaS is a modern, cloud-native platform for Reinforcement Learning as a Service, specifically designed for multi-objective optimization scenarios such as 5G networks and recommendation systems.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The platform follows an 8-layer architecture:

1. **User Access Layer** - Web Console, API Gateway, CLI, SDK
2. **Intelligent Decision Layer** - Multi-Objective Optimization, Conflict Resolution, Policy Engine
3. **Model Management Layer** - Model Registry, Version Control, Storage, Metadata
4. **Training Platform Layer** - Orchestration, Distributed Training, HPO, Experiment Tracking
5. **Inference Service Layer** - Model Serving, A/B Testing, Load Balancing, Edge Inference
6. **Data Platform Layer** - Data Lake, Stream Processing, Feature Store, Data Validation
7. **Infrastructure Layer** - Kubernetes, Service Mesh, Monitoring, Storage
8. **Security & Governance Layer** - Model Governance, Data Privacy, Access Control, Audit
